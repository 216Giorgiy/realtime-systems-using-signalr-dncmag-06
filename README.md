Realtime Systems Using SignalR
========================================

Filip Ekberg explains the difference between real-time and near real-time systems and how to use SignalR to build near-real-time systems

Getting Started
---------------
* If you have Visual Studio Pro or above use the DNC___Demos _Pro.sln to open all the projects at once.
* If you have the Express versions use the respective Express editions for the separate projects. Start the DNC_Demos _Server.sln first.
* Make sure the HubServer is running before you try to connect either the Console client or the WinRT client.
